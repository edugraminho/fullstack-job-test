# Frontend Documentation

## Technologies Used

### 1. Next.js:

In this project, Next.js is used to handle routing, server-side data fetching, and component management.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### 2. React:

The project uses React to create reusable UI components such as forms, buttons, lists, and other visual elements of the application.

### 3. Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is used for styling all components in the project, providing responsive and modern designs with minimal effort.

### 4. Fetch API:

The project uses the Fetch API to interact with the backend REST API for creating accounts, viewing statements, and fetching account balances.

### 5. Vercel:

This project can be easily deployed on Vercel to take advantage of Next.js optimization and serverless functions.
